This assignment focuses on practical database management tasks using SQL. It aims to enhance your skills in creating, manipulating, and querying relational databases. 
You will create two tables, Country and Persons, and perform various operations to retrieve and analyze data using SQL queries.
Here's an overview of the key learning objectives and tasks:

Learning Objectives
1. Understand the process of creating and populating tables in SQL.
2. Practice using SQL commands to insert, query, and filter data.
3. Learn how to use SQL functions, aliases, and conditions effectively.
4. Explore the use of relational concepts like primary keys and foreign keys.
Tasks Overview
1.Table Creation and Data Insertion:
Create two tables:
Country with fields: Id, Country_name, Population, and Area.
Persons with fields: Id, Fname, Lname, Population, Rating, Country_Id, and Country_name.
Insert 10 rows of sample data into each table to simulate real-world scenarios.
2 SQL Queries:
Query 1: List the distinct country names from the Persons table.
Query 2: Select first names and last names from the Persons table with aliases for columns.
Query 3: Find all persons with a rating greater than 4.0.
Query 4: Find countries with a population greater than 10 lakhs (1 million).
Query 5: Find persons who are from 'USA' or have a rating greater than 4.5.
Query 6: Find all persons where the country name is NULL.
Query 7: Find all persons from the countries 'USA', 'Canada', and 'UK'.
Query 8: Find all persons not from the countries 'India' and 'Australia'.
Query 9: Find all countries with a population between 5 lakhs (500,000) and 20 lakhs (2 million).
Query 10: Find all countries whose names do not start with the letter 'C'.

By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience with table design, data insertion, and writing SQL queries for filtering, aggregating, and retrieving data based on specific conditions.
